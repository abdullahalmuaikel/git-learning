   <h1>Why you should use Git</h1> 
   <p>Git is important because it helps you track changes in your code, work with others on the same project, and safely experiment with new ideas without losing progress. It also allows you to go back to earlier versions if something breaks, making your project more reliable, organized, and easier to manage as it grows.</p>
